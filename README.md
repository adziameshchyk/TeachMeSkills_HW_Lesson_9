# OOP in Java. Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.

>This repository was created for homework in lessons â„–7-8 - "Inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism".
## Tasks

### Mandatory tasks:
0. Create a class that describes a vector in a two-dimensional coordinate system.  
   Create a class that describes a vector in a 3D coordinate system.  
   Each class must have:  
   - a constructor with parameters in the form of a list of coordinates (for example, x, y, z);
   - method that calculates the length of a vector. The root can be calculated using Math.sqrt();
   - method that calculates the scalar product;
   - vector addition method;
   - vector difference method;
   - a static method that takes an integer N, and returns an array of random vectors of size N.  
   
   Provide comparison of vectors using the "equals()" method.  
   Display information about a vector using the toString method.  

### Additional tasks:
1. Generalize the previous task and write one Vector class for an arbitrary dimension.  
   To do this, in the vector class you should use an array to store coordinates.
